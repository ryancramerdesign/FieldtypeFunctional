# About Functional Fields

Functional fields are an entirely different way to define fields in ProcessWire, 
and they are really quite a convenient time saver for many cases. They are 
perfect for all of those text phrases and blocks you might be using in your 
template files that don't quite fit a traditional field. Things like postal 
addresses, copyright lines, phone numbers, action links like “Read More”, 
button text, disclaimers, table headings, alt tags for static images, and 
literally anything that you might use text for in your template files.

For details and usage instructions, please see the Functional Fields post at:
